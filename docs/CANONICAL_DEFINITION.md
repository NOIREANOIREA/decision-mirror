# Decision Mirror — Canonical Definition v1.0

Decision Mirror is a governance framework designed to preserve
human agency in automated and assistive systems.

It operates by ensuring that:

1. **No system capability is admitted**
   before human awareness and veto are structurally possible.

2. **Responsibility for decisions**
   remains attributable to identifiable human actors.

3. **Irreversible or opaque system behaviors**
   require documented deliberation and approval.

4. **Optimization, prediction, or adaptation**
   must not precede explicit governance review.

5. **System evolution must remain explainable**
   through versioned records and boundary cases.

Decision Mirror governs admission of power,
not evaluation of outcomes.
