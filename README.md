# Decision Mirror

Decision Mirror is a governance framework
for preserving human agency
in automated and assistive systems.

It ensures that system capabilities
are admitted only after
human awareness and veto are structurally possible.

---

## Why Decision Mirror

Modern systems often optimize
before responsibility is established.

Decision Mirror prevents
silent shifts of control
and preserves accountability.
